  <h1>Logo/Identity PROFILE for Leigh Ann French</h1>

  <h2>Front-End Web Developer</h2>
  <p>What position are you seeking? Front-End Web Developer</p>

  <h2>Concepts</h2>
  <p>What association do you want people to have when they think of you? I want people to know I have a strong work ethic; that they can rely on me to get the job done. </p>

  <h2>Skill Sets</h2>
  <p>What skill sets are you looking to promote? I want to promote not only my coding skills but also soft skills. Such as my ability to work in a team, strong time management skills, attention and awareness to deadlines, and most importantly, the ability to be teachable/coachable. </p>

  <h2>Colors</h2>
  <p>What colors are you thinking about for your “brand”?  Limit to 2 or 3 colors.  If you need more, write about the reasons. I am thinking about purple as the main color. It is my favorite color and it is not user often so I think it will stand out more. I would pair light gold as an accent or just with black</p>

  <h2>Graphics</h2>
  <p>What kind of graphics, images, shapes, or icons will help associate you with the skills, a job, or branding concept? 
    As far as icons or images go I was thinking about a few things. For one I was thinking to try to tie in my biology/Physical Therapist Assistant back ground by using an image of a person walker, an image of DNA, or bone. 
  </p>

  <h2>Shape Ideas</h2>
  <p>What will be the overall “background” shape of your identity mark, if any? Square, Circle, Rectangle…? 
    I am still working on this for sure. I like natural shapes and shapes that something to represent nature. Stars and moons are always good because we should always be reaching for new heights.
